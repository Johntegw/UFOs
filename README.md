# UFOs- Module 12 Challenge
 
Overview of Project:

Dana would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings to her webpage by allowing users to filter on multiple criteria at the same time. In addition adding  table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


Results: 

Based on the required new criteria that Dana wanted to provide to the users of her webpage; we developed four new search boxes that can be used. Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.!
The image below represents the updated code for users to be able to search by category. The four categories that are represented is date, city, country, and shape.
